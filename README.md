# Research: Microfrontends  

## 1. Foundations:
  We will be understanding the fundaments of micro frontends. We will use WebPack and some plugins to build a simple 
  page consuming HTML and JavaScript.

## 2. WebPack Federation Module with Frameworks
  Based on the foundations we will be creating a simple page where we will consume a React component and a Vue Component, but always being abstract in the container.
  Meaning that if in the future we need to change any component to another platform, we should replace or add a new component without care the source.

  Here we will be using: WebPack Module Federation, React, and Vue. 

## 3. Pending Features

  - How we can improve the speed with Vite?.
  - Test the tool BIT and its approach.
